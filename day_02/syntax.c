  Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf()
  Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable
  Line 3: Another thing that always appear in a C program, is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
  Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example it will output "Hello World".
  Line 5: return 0 ends the main() function.
  Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
